## About Me

I'm a junior at Harvard studying computer science and statistics. Here are some of projects I've worked (or am working) on.

### I like...

#### training models on large (and small) datasets
- [InferBiomechanics](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/InferBiomechanics.git) (WIP) - models for motion generation and dynamics prediction 🦵
    - I'm currently developing the `dynamics_inference` and `diffusion` branches with [camilobrownpinilla](https://github.com/camilobrownpinilla)
- [MiniDiffusion](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/MiniDiffusion.git) - implementation of [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) for image generation 🏞️
- [TimeSeriesForecasting](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/TimeSeriesForecasting.git) (WIP) - random forest and LSTM models for financial time series classification 📈

#### music
- [VioLibrary](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/VioLibrary.git) - a full-stack web app for violin repertoire exploration and recommendation 🎻

#### language
- [SlavicGPT](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/SlavicGPT.git) (WIP) - generate your own fresh Dostoevsky and Tolstoy with GPTs trained on Russian text and Slavic literature ✍️
- [bardle](https://jbejjani2022.github.io/bardle/) - a Shakespearean wordle 🪶

#### math
- [NetworkConnectivity](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/NetworkConnectivity.git) - a linear algebra approach to graph theory ✖️

#### other fun things
- [SnakeCube](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/SnakeCube.git) - Snake, but 3D...and with LEDs! 🐍
- [PodcastPal](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/PodcastPal.git) - chat with an AI assistant about a Lex Fridman podcast episode 🤖
- [MiniML](https://github.com/jbejjani2022/MiniML.git) - some OCaml metacircular interpreters 🐪
